The digital world is no stranger to occasional glitches and vulnerabilities, and recently, WhatsApp users have encountered a peculiar issue. While sending long messages filled with emojis and special characters to slow down or crash devices has been a known trick, a new bug has surfaced, causing chats to crash upon opening a specific message ("[wa.me/settings](http://wa.me/settings)" or "[**http://wa.me/settings**](http://wa.me/settings)"). In this blog post, we will delve into the origins of this bug, its impact, and potential solutions. Join us as we uncover the mystery behind this unsettling glitch in WhatsApp and discover how to protect your messaging experience.

### Why is This Happening?

The WhatsApp bug that triggers chat crashes with this message has left users pondering over its underlying causes. There are several possible explanations, including:

1. Software Glitch or Programming Oversight: Bugs often arise due to glitches in the software or oversights in programming. It is possible that a coding error or unintended interaction within WhatsApp's codebase is triggered by this message, resulting in crashes in the affected chat.
    
2. Combination of Characters: The specific combination of characters within the message might cause an unexpected parsing or rendering issue when WhatsApp processes the content. This could lead to errors and crashes when attempting to open the chat.
    
3. Exploiting Vulnerability: There is a chance that this bug exploits an underlying vulnerability within WhatsApp's messaging system. Malicious actors may have identified weaknesses in the application's code or communication protocols, using specific message inputs to induce chat crashes.
    

WhatsApp's development team is actively investigating and working on a fix. Users should exercise caution when encountering the triggering message.

### Update 1

In response to valuable feedback, a temporary solution has been discovered! To address the issue, one can employ a simple technique:

Continuously sending messages in the chat until the "[wa.me/settings](http://wa.me/settings)" link moves up and is no longer visible on the screen. This effectively prevents the WhatsApp application from crashing. However, it's important to note that scrolling up to the message can still lead to crashes. For a complete resolution, it is advised to follow the solution mentioned above.
